# Power_monitoring_system
Power monitor system is a project Im working on as a part of my contribution to the microprocessors lab ,using STM 32 wb with the monitoring and the estimate levels.

# Setup:
1. Stm32 nucleo
2. dht 11 for moisture levels
3. voltage sensor
4. A custom voltage source (VCC) generated from scratch (as a store bought one is very expensive)
   ( Ill add the assemby for the source as well ;) )

# and ...
I took wayy more time than what I had promised due to un forseen conditions

Aioo , Anbuselvi ma'am please forgive me , Im sorry :/
